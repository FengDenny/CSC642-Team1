# Project Description

_In short_, To help speed up the process, for the medical companies, in finding participants for their clinical trials, our team will create an application, allowing participants to search for trials, choose in which to participate, and to be paid for testing different types of drugs. Participants have the ability to browse around and sign up for different medical trials if they pass all the specified requirements listed for those trials.

# How Team 1 build this project

For creating this project, our class had to implement 6 different phases
(can be found inside the documentation folder):

1. Initial Proposal (Personas and 3 Use Cases approach )
2. Initial (low fidelity) UI/UX design (Figma)
3. High fidelity UI design (Figma)
4. Usability evaluation/testing
5. Focus groups exercise (Figma)
6. Final implementation and QA testing

# Platforms and Tools

In order to deliver a responsive real-world application, our team will be mainly focusing on building desktop and mobile platforms versions of our application. Using the Figma design tool, we had transitioned our low fidelity designed wireframes and storyboard mockups to high fidelity by replacing black and white coloring from our low fidelity and reconfiguring it to our application color.

# Website Demo

Feel free to toggle around with the functionalities, but since our backend was a stimulation, this project is only able to perform a single post/apply for trials stimulation.
